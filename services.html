<h1>Overview of Services</h1>
<h2>Intake Appointment</h2>
<p>The first meeting with a counselor typically lasts 45-50 minutes. This is an opportunity to discuss your presenting concerns and develop a treatment plan based on your needs. You are required to complete standardized paperwork prior to the appointment, and are asked to arrive 30 minutes early. Your counselor will likely ask questions about your mental health history, family, background, and current functioning, to develop the most appropriate plan with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Call (973) 36865786,17330786 for taking appointment.(available 24/7).</li>
<li>You may also be able to schedule an intake appointment in advance. Call to check on availability, as there are a limited number of appointments.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Individual Counseling</h2>
<p>Students receiving short-term counseling will meet for an average of four to six 50-minute sessions scheduled weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. While counseling experiences can vary greatly from person to person, a few topics appropriate for short-term counseling are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing time and academic stress</li>
<li>Managing mood and thoughts</li>
<li>Relationship support</li>
<li>Navigating life transitions as well as academic and career decision-making</li>
</ul>

<p>Following a course of short-term counseling, students can request referrals for continued care in the community. If a student returns to the CC with the same presenting concerns, a referral for open-ended or longer-term care will be pursued. If a student is returning due to a new presenting concern or stressor, they may re-engage in short-term counseling if they and their intake counselor decide their needs can be appropriately met with another course of short-term treatment.</p>


<h2>Referrals</h2>
<p>One of the services provided by the Counseling Center is referral to mental health providers in the community.  The Counseling Center is able to provide students with short-term services, but there are times when longer or more specialized care is more appropriate.  In these cases we try to help UW students find providers in the community who can offer them these types of care.</p>
<p>Our hope is to help students find clinicians who have skill sets, therapeutic approaches, and areas of specialty that match the student’s concerns.  We also try to match students with providers who are located in a specific area, accept specific kinds of insurance or offer more affordable counseling. You may contact the Counseling Center by phone to inquire about referral options or this may be discussed during an intake appointment.</p>

<h2>Groups</h2>
<p>Our group offerings vary from quarter to quarter. We aim to run a 4-6 week Mindfulness group at least once each quarter. Students are welcome to engage in short-term individual counseling while also participating in a group at the Counseling Center.</p>

<h2>Couples Counseling</h2>
<p>Offered based on counselor availability. One member of the couple must be a currently enrolled UW student; both members of the couple will complete intake paperwork. Students are not able to engage in individual and couples counseling concurrently.</p>
